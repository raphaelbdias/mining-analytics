# Mining Analytics Hub Prototype

Welcome to the Mining Analytics Hub Prototype - a Flask web application designed to provide mining companies with real-time and static analytics. This repository contains the source code, documentation, and presentation materials for this innovative project.

## Key Features:

1. **Responsive Design:** User-friendly interface with a side navigation bar for seamless access to Personnel, Equipment, Vehicles, and Materials Mined/Ore Analytics sections.

2. **Home/Summary Page:** Quick overview of critical metrics, providing a snapshot of your mining operations.

3. **Real-time & Static Analytics:** Detailed analytics for Personnel, Equipment, Vehicles, and Materials Mined/Ore, with real-time updates and insightful visual representations.

4. **Flask Framework:** Backend powered by Flask, a robust web framework for efficient server-side development.

5. **Dummy Data Generation:** For demonstration purposes, a dummy data generation system ensures a realistic showcase of the application's capabilities.

6. **API Endpoints:** Well-defined API endpoints facilitate smooth communication between the frontend and backend.

7. **Database Integration:** Seamless integration with SQLite, chosen for simplicity in the development stage.

8. **User Authentication (Optional):** Basic user authentication system showcasing potential for personalized dashboards and enhanced security.

9. **Analytics Representation:** Utilize graphs, charts, and tables to interpret analytics data effectively, providing a comprehensive understanding of mining operations.

## Dummy Data Structure:

- **Personnel:** Employee ID, Name, Position, Shift, Hours Worked, Productivity Metrics.
- **Equipment:** Equipment ID, Type of Systems, Status, Maintenance Schedule, Usage Statistics, Overhaul History.
- **Vehicles:** Vehicle ID, Type, Fuel Consumption, Distance Traveled, Maintenance History, Type of Systems, Overhaul History, Vehicle Renewal, and Sale.
- **Materials Mined/Ore Analytics:** Material ID, Type, Mining Law, Quantity Mined, Quality Metrics, Production Rates.

## Deliverables:

1. **Prototype Web Application:** Explore the source code and set up instructions for running the application locally.

2. **Documentation:** Technical documentation detailing architecture, code structure, API endpoints, and user documentation providing instructions on using the prototype.

3. **Presentation:** Comprehensive presentation showcasing the prototype's features, critical functionalities, and potential customizations.
